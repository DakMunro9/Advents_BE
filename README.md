# Starting the development server

After creating the application, you can start the development server by running the following command.

```
node ace serve --watch
```

The serve command starts the HTTP server and performs an in-memory compilation of TypeScript to JavaScript.
The --watch flag is meant to watch the file system for changes and restart the server automatically.
By default, the server starts on port 3333 (defined inside the .env file). You can view the welcome page by visiting: http://localhost:3333 .
